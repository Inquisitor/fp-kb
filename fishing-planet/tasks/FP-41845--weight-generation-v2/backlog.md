# FP-41845 — Backlog

## Phase 1: Instrumentation & Simulation

### 1.1 Understand production data & validate FishFact
- [x] Study `FishFact` table — schema, fields, SQL patches, write sites in code → [fish-fact.md](../../server/modules/fish-generator/fish-fact.md)
- [x] Determine what production data is available per fish/pond/form — FishId = form ID, Weight, Source, all lifecycle events
- [x] Production config confirmed: `CollectFishGenerationStats` = ON, `FishGenerationStatsCleanupHorizonDays` = 90
- [x] Build SQL query — single query with PIVOT by form (WeightBucket | Y | C | T | U | Total), Source='B' filter
- [x] Tested on Northern Pike @ Saint-Croix (step=0.5 kg) and Nile Perch @ Congo (step=1 kg) — data quality confirmed
- [x] Histograms match expected patterns: Common/Trophy = flat rectangle + spike at 95%; Young = right-skewed hyperbola with sharp spike; Unique = bimodal "horns" with suppressed edges — all consistent with form polynomial effects
- [x] Output format: TSV → spreadsheet, percentages via `=IFERROR(cell/SUM(col), 0)` per form

### 1.2 Understand generation pipeline completeness
- [x] All generation paths write to FishFact (B, X, W, C, A, M, S, E, P, D) → [fish-fact.md](../../server/modules/fish-generator/fish-fact.md)
- [x] Simulator scope: **BiteSystem path only** (Source='B'). Target fish come exclusively from BiteSystem; other sources (FishBox, FishGenerator carousel, etc.) are legacy and use a different weight algorithm (`GameUtils.RandomizeFishWeight`). Note: BiteSystem has its own internal carousel (FishSelector) for fish selection — this is the primary production mechanism
- [~] Document simulator config requirements — partially done, see below

#### Key findings from 1.2
- All weight generation parameters (polynomials, threshold, sigma, MinWeight/MaxWeight, form) live in BiteSystem code and config — simulator will use them directly via real code, no hardcoding needed
- `weightK` comes from the **chum (groundbait) system** particles, not from pond/fish config. Without chum, weightK=1.0 and has no effect. All known weightK bugs (double application, threshold lowering, asymmetric return) only manifest when chum is used
- Simulator approach: **invoke real BiteSystem code** (no code copying) — see 1.3 for options

### 1.3 Build simulator

**Constraint: NO code copying.** Simulator must invoke the real BiteSystem code — not re-implement or hardcode any part of the algorithm (polynomials, Marsaglia, thresholds, etc.). Two candidate approaches:

**Option A — Server-side endpoint:** Add an operation to the game server that runs N weight generations for a given fish/pond/form and returns histogram data. Requires running the server.

**Option B — WebAdmin integration:** If BiteSystem is accessible from WebAdmin (it already shows PondSettings), add a simulation page/controller that runs N generations and renders histograms. Benefit: charting can be built in the same place.

- [ ] Investigate which assemblies WebAdmin references — does it have access to `BiteSystem` / `FishDescription.GenerateRandomWeight()`?
- [ ] If yes → design WebAdmin controller/page for simulation with chart output
- [ ] If no → design server-side endpoint approach
- [ ] Implement chosen approach: run N iterations for a specific fish+pond+form using real BiteSystem code with real configuration
- [ ] Output results in agreed format with same bucket granularity as production stats for comparability
- [ ] Add charting capability (histograms per form, overlay with production data)

**Design note:** architect the simulator to accept `weightK` parameter (for chum effect analysis) and external form proportions (for combined overall histogram). Form ratio estimation is a separate module backlog item — see [fish-selector-form-ratio.md](../../server/modules/fish-generator/fish-selector-form-ratio.md) — but the simulator API should make integration trivial: `run(fish, form, weightK, N) → histogram` per form, then combine with proportions externally.

### 1.4 Validate simulator against production
- [ ] Get fish IDs of interest from game designers (start with reference fish from 1.1)
- [ ] Compare simulated histograms vs production histograms — verify shapes match within each form
- [ ] Investigate and explain discrepancies (if any)

## Phase 2: Algorithm Design & Implementation
(to be defined after phase 1 — depends on what simulation reveals and GD requirements)

## Phase 3: Documentation (FP-41844)
(blocked until phase 2 complete — artifacts from phases 1-2 become source material)

## Deferred / Questions
- ~~Real ratio between forms (Young/Common/Trophy/Unique)~~ — investigated: proportions are emergent from FishSelector layer config, can be estimated from pond config or taken from FishFact. See [fish-selector-form-ratio.md](../../server/modules/fish-generator/fish-selector-form-ratio.md). Combined overall histogram = Σ(p_form × dist_form).
- Unique polynomial "double hump" phenomenon — explain to Stanislav in detail when relevant
