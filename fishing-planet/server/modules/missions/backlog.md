# Missions — Backlog

## Test Coverage

- `MatchFishPredicate()` has zero test coverage — all `IFishCondition` fields uncovered (HookDepth, MaxHookDepth, MinGenerationDepth, MaxGenerationDepth, Weight, Length, FishForm, etc.)
- No tests for any `FishCondition` subclass (HookFishCondition, CatchFishCondition, FightFishCondition, etc.)
- No tests for `ReleaseFishFromCageInteraction` condition matching
