# Fish Generator
> Spawns fish, assigns weight via bias-aware randomization, determines hookability.

## Entry Points
- `FishGenerator` — `Photon/src-server/GameModel/FishGenerator.cs` (core generation, hooking, rounding)
- `FishWeightGenerator` — `Shared/BiteSystem/ServerOnly/FishWeight/FishWeightGenerator.cs` (BiteSystem weight pipeline)

## Key Types
- `FishTemplate` — generated fish instance (weight, IdealHookSize, source, box)
- `FishWeightGeneratorConfig` — immutable edge distribution config (algorithm, scope, zones)
- `FishWeightRounding` — shared rounding constants for production/simulator sync
- `Hooker` — hooking probability curve (piecewise: low wing / peak / high wing)
- `NormalRandom` — Box-Muller RNG (linear, half-normal, full-normal distributions)
- `LocalFish` / `ServerFish` — fish form and species config

## Dependencies
→ BiteSystem: `GenerateAttackForBiteSystem()` calls `Pond.GetFish()`
→ ObjectModel: LocalFish, Fish, FishCarouselItem, FishWeightBias
→ SharedLib/Game: ServerFish, CurrentGameConfig, RodInGameConfig
← GameProcessor: owns FishGenerator, orchestrates fishing session
← MultiRodGameProcessor: multi-rod sessions

## Deep Dives
- [Weight generation](weight-generation.md) — algorithm, sources, downstream effects, lifecycle
- [Normal distribution](normal-distribution.md) — two implementations (NormalRandom vs NormalDistribution), parameters, form polynomials
- [FishFact statistics](fish-fact.md) — lifecycle table in Stats DB, schema, source codes, existing queries
- [Test coverage](test-coverage.md) — inventory of tests, gaps, potential code issues
- [FishSelector form ratio](fish-selector-form-ratio.md) — how Y:C:T:U proportions emerge from FishSelector config, estimation approach
- [Edge distribution](edge-distribution.md) — edge distribution approaches, normalization, correct sampling; design rationale for FP-41845
